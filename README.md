# RiskOfRuinaMod
This repository contains my attempt to decompile and update the Risk of Ruina mod for Risk of Rain 2 after being seemingly abandoned by its developers. This mod is NOT my original creation. Credit for that goes to the original developers, who can be found in the legacy mod's page: 
https://thunderstore.io/package/Scoops/Risk_Of_Ruina

This particular version was decompiled in dotpeek. I made some changes to it, but the code seems to have a lot of strange and unfixable errors. It's locked up in this branch in case I figure out what to do with it.
